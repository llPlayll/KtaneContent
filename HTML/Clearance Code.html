                <h2>On the Subject of Clearance Code</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">You are nested with so much protection. Do you feel stressed out now?</p>
                <p><strong>The contents of this manual only describe the normal procedure, which may be overridden.</strong></p>
                <p>The module consists of 10 buttons numbered 0-9 in a circular position, and a display in the center of the buttons.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the module, 4 buttons will light up.
                    Buttons that are lit up will have their texts in black and their buttons in white, and vice versa.
                    Starting from the top button and moving clockwise, create a 4 digit number using the digits in the lit buttons.
                    The first lit button will be the first digit, the second will be the second, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    After a <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=clearanceCodeModule">non-ignored</a> module is solved, the buttons will randomize their positions and all the lit buttons will turn off.
                    Locate the new positions of the digits that you gathered.
                    Moving clockwise, calculate the distance of their initial positions and their current positions.
                    Add the distances to their respective digits.
                    If the result goes over nine, use the least significant digit.
                    After that, type the code that was calculated. This will become your “final code” for later stages.
                    If the code is correct, the lights beside the display will flash green, and you would be able to continue to solve modules without problem.
                    If the code is incorrect, or a non-ignored module was solved while this module is waiting for the correct code, the light beside the display will flash red and a strike will occur.
                    <strong>This stage must still be completed, otherwise more strikes will occur.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    After inputting the first code correctly, a new set of 4 buttons will light up from the current arrangement of digits.
                    For stage 2 and every even numbered stage afterwards, the distances between digits must go <strong>counter-clockwise, rather than clockwise.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Then, after adding the distances to each of the new digits, you will then need to subtract each digit of the resulting code for that stage by each digit of the “final code” of the previous stage, to make your “final code” for this stage, adding ten if a digit goes into the negatives. This procedure is repeated for all stages, with stages 3, 4, and every 4 stages after those with the initial digits on those stages gathered in the <strong>opposite direction.</strong></p>

                <p>Repeat until all the non-ignored modules have been solved. Inputting the code correctly one last time will disarm the module.</p>
                <p>If at any point this module strikes, the module will light up each pair of digits in color, one of which will be filled in and have black text, and the other will just be colored. If only one is colored, it will be paired by itself. Each pair of digits that light up in color correspond to the distance between the two, and the initial digit of the 4 digit number for this stage, if the digit was in black text, or its initial position otherwise.
                    The “final code” from the previous stage will be displayed as input, if there is a previous stage. The code can still be inputted as normal.</p>

                <h2>On the Modification of Clearance Code</h2>
                <p>There are multiple settings for this module, which can be configured. All of these have CC prefixed on the options provided:</p>
                <ul class="smaller">
                    <li><strong><code>DigitsDisplayed</code></strong>: The amount of digits to display for each stage. Can be set as low as 3 or as high as 16. Digits above 9 will be displayed as letters instead, starting from A. <strong>For ANY stage that has its digits outside of the range after adding/subtracting, this number is used instead to add/subtract to keep a digit within the bounds. The maxmium value is also affected by this.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong><code>DigitsRequired</code></strong>: The amount of digits to light up for each stage, and to input. Can be set as low as 2 or as high as the number of digits displayed.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>RequireLastStage</code></strong>: If false, disables the module to require obtaining the code from the previous stage. This toggles the “final code” calculations for each stage after the first.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>StagesPerCodeOperSwap</code></strong>: Does nothing if <code>RequireLastStage</code> is disabled. W will refer to the number set by this option. The first W stage(s) <strong>after stage 1</strong> require subtracting each digit of the “final code” from each digit of the code obtained after calculating the distances, then the next W stage(s) require adding those, and so on. <strong>0 makes the operation subtraction ONLY. If W is less than 0, the operations start with adding the each digit of the “final code” before alternating.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong><code>StagesPerSeqDirSwap</code></strong>: X will refer to the number set by this option. The first X stage(s) require digits to be obtained clockwise, then the next X stage(s) counter-clockwise, and so on. <strong>0 forces the direction for obtaining digits to be clockwise ONLY. If X is less than 0, the directions from the procedure start counter-clockwise.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong><code>StagesPerDistDirSwap</code></strong>: Y will refer to the number set by this option. The first Y stage(s) require the distance between the digits to be obtained clockwise, then the next Y stage(s) counter-clockwise, and so on. <strong>0 forces the direction for calculating distances to be clockwise ONLY. If Y is less than 0, the directions from the procedure start counter-clockwise.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong><code>StagesPerDistOperSwap</code></strong>: Z will refer to the number set by this option. The first Z stage(s) require each digit to have their distances added, then the next Z stage(s) to have their distances subtracted, and so on. <strong>0 forces distances to ONLY be added. If Z is less than 0, the operations from the procedure start with subtracting the distances before alternating.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong><code>ShuffleDigitsAlways</code></strong>: If false, digits will only be shuffled when the module is ready to input.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Mission makers may override these settings above with the following added to the description of their respective missions with each of the items representing the options mentioned above in that order:<br>
                <strong><code>[CCOverride] #,#,&lt;true/false&gt;,#,#,#,#,&lt;true/false&gt;</code></strong><br>
                A character string will be shown in the botton left denoting the requirements for each stage. <strong>This is only visible on stage 1, and when the module is solved.</strong></p>
