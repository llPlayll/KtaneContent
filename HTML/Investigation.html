                <h2>On the Subject of Investigation</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Sometimes, software is feeble. It’s just kinda there and you use it and it pisses you off at times but you put up with it as there’s no better alternative. I, the creator, hope it comes off as charming.</p>

                <p>This module contains many transcripts of team solves of challenge bombs being disarmed. You will be given one of these transcripts via the module. Your goal is to figure out which bomb is being solved. Submit the name of this bomb to disarm the module.</p>
                <p>At the top of the module is a search bar. Type using your keyboard to enter a search query. When you press enter, the module will display <u>up to the first ten times</u> your input is present in the transcript, in chronological order, alongside adjacent words so further context can be gathered. There is no limit to how many searches you can make. Use the scroll bar to sift through each occurrence of your input.</p>
                <p>You are allowed to search up to five words, but it is recommended that you start with single words before attempting to use word phrases. Note that the number of adjacent words will be inversely proportional to how many words your search contains.</p>
                <p>The <a href="https://bombs.samfun.dev/">Challenge Bombs Website</a> is strongly recommended to gather various information, to deduce which bombs are potential candidates. Hover over the website’s search box for a tooltip on how to create more powerful searches.</p>
                <p>Note that the transcripts were obtained via automatic captioning from YouTube, and as such the words in the transcript will not exactly match the words spoken. Keep this in mind when coming across anything one may deem nonsensical.</p>
                <p>Once the defused bomb in the transcript has been determined, press “Continue”, then use the search box to search for the bomb’s name. Press “Submit” when the name is <b>in bold</b>. Note that after pressing “Continue” <b>you will not be able to return to the transcript</b>.</p>
                <p>The module will strike upon an incorrect submission, and return to its original state. The answer will not change.</p>
